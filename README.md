# ML_Project-Fake_News_Prediction

This project explores the task of identifying fake news articles using Logistic Regression, a powerful machine learning technique. By analyzing text data from news articles, the model aims to distinguish factual news from fabricated content.

### Data:

This directory stores the news article data, typically in CSV format. The dataset might contain features like:

- id (unique identifier for each news article)
- title (headline of the news article)
- author (author of the news article)
- text (full text of the news article)
- label (0 for real news, 1 for fake news)

**Note:** You might need to adjust this list based on your specific dataset.

### Notebooks:

This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook (`fake_news_prediction.ipynb`) for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Running the Project

The Jupyter Notebook (`fake_news_prediction.ipynb`) guides you through the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Loads the news article data.
    - Explores data distribution, identifying missing values and text characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handles missing values (text cleaning).
    - Prepares text data for modeling (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
    - Converts textual features into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF).
3. **Feature Engineering (Optional):**
    - Creates additional features from text data (e.g., sentiment analysis scores, named entity recognition).
4. **Model Training with Logistic Regression:**
    - Trains the model, potentially tuning hyperparameters.
5. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualization of Results:**
    - Analyzes the confusion matrix to understand model performance on different news categories.
    - Explores the impact of specific words or phrases on model predictions.

### Text Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- Text data requires specific preprocessing steps for machine learning models. 
- The project focuses on techniques like:
    - Removing irrelevant characters (punctuation, special symbols).
    - Converting text to lowercase.
    - Removing stop words (common words that don't contribute much meaning).
    - Applying stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
    - Converting text into numerical features (e.g., TF-IDF) suitable for the model.

### Customization

- Modify the Jupyter Notebook to:
    - Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques and feature engineering methods.
    - Try other classification algorithms for comparison (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines with text kernels).
    - Explore advanced techniques like deep learning models specifically designed for text classification.

### Further Contributions

- Extend this project by:
    - Incorporating additional news sources or data from social media platforms.
    - Implementing a real-time fake news detection system using a trained model and an API.
    - Exploring explainability techniques to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.

By leveraging Logistic Regression and text processing techniques, we can analyze news articles and potentially build a model to identify fake news. This project provides a foundation for further exploration in fake news detection and responsible news consumption in the digital age.
